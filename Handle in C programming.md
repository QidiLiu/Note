[Defination](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-handle-in-C-programming): 
- The simplest definition of a handle in C programming is that it is just a pointer to a pointer. It can have many uses, but one of the easiest to grasp is one where the operating system might need to move blocks of memory around on the heap.
- For example, assume you need a 1M block of memory. If you malloc that block, it might start at, for example, memory location 0x10000. But then, that location is fixed and canâ€™t be moved for as long as the program needs to access it. And this can be a problem if memory is becoming fragmented.
- So instead, you can create a handle. In this case, your program manages the pointer p, but allow the operating system to manage the pointer \*p. By doing this, the block pointed to by \*p can be moved, and \*p pointed to a new block. Your program can then access the memory with \*\*p, \*p[x], or similar suitable pointer arithmetic. And the beauty of it is that though the OS may have moved \*p in the meantime, the double dereferencing will find the new memory location no matter where it might have been moved to.
